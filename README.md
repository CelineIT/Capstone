# Sugar-consumption-and-Obesity

## Overview
This project will look into the evolution of sugar consumption worldwide and its impact on American people and the rest of the world. We will look at sugar consumption from 1975 to 2016 and the evolution of obesity during those years.



## Motivation
<p>Eating a healthy diet is becoming more and more difficult as sugar is being added to most of the food we can buy at the grocery store. Meanwhile, the obesity rate in many countries has been increasing considerately over the past 50 years.</p>
I would like to see if the increase in sugar consumption has an impact on obesity and if there is a correlation between the two.<br>
<br>
Obesity is a known fact and there are 2 main factors for it:<br>

1. People are not educated enough about what they eat, the nutritional value of their meal and the impact each nutrient has on their weight/health.
1. Even for someone who understands the consequences of eating too much sugar, it is still extremely difficult to stay away from sugar while grocery shopping. Sugar is present in all the products sold in a regular grocery store and in abundance. Marketing experts are doing a great job hiding it within the ingredient list under different names (glucose, fructose, sucrose etcâ€¦). Unless you are a nutritionist, it is nearly impossible to keep track of it.


## Data Question

Is there a direct correlation between sugar consumption and obesity?

## Analysis:
Here are the steps of my analysis:
1. Evolution of sugar consumption 
1. Evolution of the population 
1. Evolution of sugar consumption Per Capita 
1. Evolution of obesity 
1. Comparison of sugar consumption Per Capita to Obesity Rate
1. Calculate the correlation coefficient between the two
1. Conclusions
